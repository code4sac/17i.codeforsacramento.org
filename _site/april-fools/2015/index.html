<h1 id="april-fools-2015">April Fools 2015</h1>

<p>For April Fools Day 2015, we changed our slogan from “Building the 21st
century digital government” to “Have you tried turning it off and on again?”</p>

<p>A screenshot is shown below:</p>

<p>We also sent <a href="https://twitter.com/18F/status/583273382386348032">a tweet</a>
to promote the joke.</p>
