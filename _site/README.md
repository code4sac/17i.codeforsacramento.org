# We forked 18F's flagship website

What if Code for Sacramento became a consultancy to ensure long-term sustainability of the organization? 17I is a prototype for conducting customer development and testing that scenario. It's a fork of [18f.gsa.gov](https://github.com/18F/18f.gsa.gov).

## Why 17I?

Code for Sacramento was birthed at [Hacker Lab](https://hackerlab.org/), located at the 17th and I Streets in Sacramento, CA. Thus, 17I.

## I want to get involved

Great! [Open an issue](https://github.com/code4sac/17i.codeforsacramento.org/issues/new).
