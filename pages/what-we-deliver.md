  <p>If your agency’s project has a digital component, our team of software developers, visual designers, writers, and security experts can help you build it. We can help you:</p>
  <ul>

  <li>Build a new site and API to showcase and synthesize data from multiple sources, as we did with Department of Education’s <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/">College Scorecard</a>.</li>
  <li>Help you make your data more accessible with a user-friendly site and developer tools, as we did with the <a href="https://beta.fec.gov/">Federal Election Commission</a>.</li>
  <li>Build web-based tools to streamline internal agency processes, as we did with <a href="https://cap.18f.gov/">Communicart</a> and <a href="https://calc.gsa.gov/">CALC</a>.</li>

  <h3><a id="Innovative_ways_to_buy_technology_0"></a>Innovative ways to buy technology</h3>
  <p>We believe federal IT acquisitions can be faster, cheaper, and produce
  better results. If your agency is developing a new request for quotation
  for IT services or is interested in innovative ways to buy technology,
  our team is excited to work with you. We can help you:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Write agile, modular, and user-centered design into your request for quotations through our RFP Ghostwriting service, like we did with the <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/03/22/helping-california-buy-a-new-child-welfare-system/">Department of Health and Human Services</a>.</li>
  <li>Develop a marketplace to buy IT services using modern techniques, like we did with the <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/ads-bpa/">Agile Blanket Purchase Agreement</a>.</li>
  <li>Buy small pieces of open source code to advance your projects, like we’re doing with our <a href="https://micropurchase.18f.gov/">micro-purchase platform</a>.</li>

  actively improved to meet your needs. We can help you:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Host your applications in the cloud with our <a href="https://cloud.gov/">cloud.gov platform</a>.</li>
  <li>Build customizable and easy-to-maintain static sites with the <a href="https://federalist.18f.gov/">Federalist platform</a>.</li>

  <h3><a id="Modern_digital_service_techniques_0"></a>Modern digital service techniques</h3>
  <p>We can provide your team with the skills and knowledge they need to
  modernize your agency’s digital services. We’ve also built a number of
  knowledge-sharing and documentation tools for 18F’s own use that you can
  copy and use at your agency. We can help you:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Run a workshop on agile software development, like the <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/08/31/how-playing-with-legos-taught-executives-agile/">Lego workshop we did with the Small Business Administration</a> or the longer one we did with the <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/02/11/a-story-of-an-agile-workshop/">Social Security Administration</a>.</li>
  <li>Host a design studio, like we did with the <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2014/09/25/design-studio-onrr/">Department of the Interior</a>.</li>
  <li>Create your own lightweight knowledge sharing platform based off 18F’s <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/guides-template/">Guides</a> and <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/">Pages</a> projects.</li>
